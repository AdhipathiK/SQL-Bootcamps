# SQL Query 1

## Situation

We have two staff members, with Staff IDs 1 and 2. We want to give a bonus to the staff member who handled the most payments.  
(Most in terms of numbers of payments processed, not in dollar amount.)  
How many payments did each staff member handle, and who gets the bonus?

## Approach

1. Use the `payment` table to find the total number of payments processed by each staff member.
2. Group the results by `staff_id` and count the number of payments (`COUNT(amount)`).
3. The staff member with the highest count gets the bonus.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT staff_id, COUNT(amount) AS total_payments
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id;

```

# SQL Query 2

## Situation

Corporate HQ is conducting a study on the relationship between replacement cost and movie rating (e.g., G, PG, R, etc.).  
What is the average replacement cost per MPAA rating?  
_Note: You may need to expand the AVG column to view correct results._

## Approach

1. Use the `film` table to find the average replacement cost for each MPAA rating.
2. Group the results by `rating`.
3. Use the `AVG()` function on the `replacement_cost` column to compute the average.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT rating, AVG(replacement_cost) AS average_replacement_cost
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

```

# SQL Query 3

## Situation

We are running a promotion to reward our top 5 customers with coupons.  
What are the customer IDs of the top 5 customers by total spend?

## Approach

1. Use the `payment` table to calculate the total spend for each customer.
2. Group the results by `customer_id`.
3. Use the `SUM()` function on the `amount` column to calculate the total amount spent by each customer.
4. Sort the results in descending order of the total spend using `ORDER BY`.
5. Limit the output to the top 5 customers using `LIMIT 5`.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
