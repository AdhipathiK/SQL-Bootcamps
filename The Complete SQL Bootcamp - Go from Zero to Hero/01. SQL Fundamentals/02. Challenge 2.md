# SQL Problem: Retrieve Distinct Movie Ratings

## Situation

An Austrian visitor isn't familiar with MPAA movie ratings (e.g., PG, PG-13, R, etc.). We want to provide them with a list of the types of ratings available in our database.

## Approach

Use a `SELECT DISTINCT` statement to retrieve the unique rating types for the films in our database.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT rating
FROM film;
```
