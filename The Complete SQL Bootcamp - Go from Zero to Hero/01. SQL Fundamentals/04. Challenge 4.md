# SQL Query 1: Retrieve Customer IDs of the First 10 Paying Customers

## Situation

We want to reward our **first 10 paying customers**. To identify them, we need their customer IDs based on the date of their first payment.

## Approach

Use a `SELECT` statement with an `ORDER BY` clause and `LIMIT` to retrieve the customer IDs of the first 10 customers who created a payment.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Payment
ORDER BY payment_date
LIMIT 10;
```

# SQL Query 2: Retrieve Titles of the 5 Shortest Movies

## Situation

A customer wants to rent a movie to watch over their short lunch break. We need to provide the titles of the **5 shortest movies** based on their runtime.

## Approach

Use a `SELECT` statement with an `ORDER BY` clause and `LIMIT` to retrieve the titles and runtimes of the 5 shortest movies.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT title, length
FROM film
ORDER BY length
LIMIT 5;
```

# SQL Query 3: Count Movies 50 Minutes or Shorter

## Situation

The previous customer can watch any movie with a runtime of **50 minutes or less**. We need to determine how many such movies are available.

## Approach

Use a `SELECT` statement with a `COUNT` function and a `WHERE` clause to calculate the number of movies that are 50 minutes or shorter.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(title)
FROM film
WHERE length <= 50;
```
