# SQL Query 1

## Situation 1: Assigning Platinum Status

We are launching a platinum service for our most loyal customers. Platinum status will be assigned to customers who have completed 40 or more payment transactions.

### Approach

1. Use the `COUNT()` function to calculate the total number of transactions (`amount`) for each customer (`customer_id`).
2. Group the results by `customer_id` to evaluate the transaction count per customer.
3. Filter the results using `HAVING` to include only those customers with a transaction count of 40 or more.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(amount) AS transaction_count
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(amount) >= 40;

```

# SQL Query 2

## Situation

Identify the customer IDs of customers who have spent more than $100 in payment transactions with staff member 2.

## Approach

1. Use the `SUM()` function to calculate the total payment amount (`amount`) for each customer (`customer_id`) where `staff_id = 2`.
2. Group the results by `customer_id` to compute the total spending for each customer.
3. Filter the results using `HAVING` to include only those customers with a total spending greater than $100.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment
WHERE staff_id = 2
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;
```
