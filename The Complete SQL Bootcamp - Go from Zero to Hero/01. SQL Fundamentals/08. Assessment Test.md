# SQL Query 1

## Situation

Return the customer IDs of customers who have spent at least $110 with the staff member who has an ID of 2.

## Approach

- Use the `SUM()` function to calculate the total amount spent by each customer with staff ID 2.
- Filter records to include only payments made to staff ID 2 using the `WHERE` clause.
- Group the results by `customer_id` using the `GROUP BY` clause.
- Apply the `HAVING` clause to filter customers whose total spending is at least $110.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE staff_id = 2
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) >= 110;

```

# SQL Query 2

## Situation

Find how many films begin with the letter 'J'.

## Approach

1. Use the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `'J%'` to match film titles that start with the letter 'J'.
2. Use the `COUNT()` function to count the number of matching film titles.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(title)
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE 'J%';
```

## SQL Query 3

### Situation

Identify the customer with the highest customer ID whose first name starts with the letter 'E' and whose address ID is lower than 500.

### Approach

1. Use the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `'E%'` to filter customers whose first name starts with 'E'.
2. Filter records where the `address_id` is less than 500.
3. Order the results by `customer_id` in descending order to prioritize the highest customer ID.
4. Use the `LIMIT` clause to return only the top record.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer
WHERE address_id < 500 AND first_name LIKE 'E%'
ORDER BY customer_id DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
