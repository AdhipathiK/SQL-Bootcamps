# Situation 1

California sales tax laws have changed, and we need to alert our customers to this through email.

## Approach

To identify the affected customers, we will query the database for the email addresses of all customers residing in California. This involves joining the `address` and `customer` tables based on their relationship and filtering for addresses in the "California" district.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT district, email
FROM address
INNER JOIN customer
ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
WHERE address.district = 'California';
```

# Situation

A customer walks in and is a huge fan of the actor 'Nick Wahlberg' and wants to know which movies he has appeared in.

## Approach

To retrieve the list of movies featuring 'Nick Wahlberg', we need to perform the following steps:

1. **Understand the Data Structure**:

   - The `actor` table contains information about actors, including their `actor_id`, first name (`first_name`), and last name (`last_name`).
   - The `film_actor` table establishes the relationship between actors and films, linking them via the `actor_id` and `film_id` columns.
   - The `film` table contains details about films, including the `film_id` and the `title` of each movie.

2. **Plan the Query**:

   - To find the movies that 'Nick Wahlberg' has acted in, we need to:
     - Identify the actor's `actor_id` from the `actor` table using their `first_name` and `last_name`.
     - Use this `actor_id` to find the related `film_id` values from the `film_actor` table.
     - Use the `film_id` values to fetch the titles of the movies from the `film` table.

3. **Perform Table Joins**:

   - Join the `film_actor` table with the `actor` table using the `actor_id` column to link each actor to their respective movies.
   - Join the `film_actor` table with the `film` table using the `film_id` column to fetch the movie titles.

4. **Filter Results**:

   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on the actor's `first_name` and `last_name`, ensuring that we only retrieve movies involving 'Nick Wahlberg'.

5. **Select Relevant Columns**:
   - Include the `title` of the movie and the actor's `first_name` and `last_name` in the final output for clarity.

## SQL Query

```sql
SELECT title, first_name, last_name
FROM film_actor
INNER JOIN actor
ON film_actor.actor_id = actor.actor_id
INNER JOIN film
ON film_actor.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE first_name = 'Nick' AND last_name = 'Wahlberg';
```
